Next steps are fixing the queue to handle more steps and be able to handle payments.
User login, Admin login and Super Admin logins go separately, User and Admin logins will get new views, SuperAdmin will use Administrate Dashboard.
Device, JWT and beef up security...

:peace_symbol: Fun is what it needs :peace_symbol:
One line of code at a time making the world a better place.... 

First we do BDD then when it matures move towards TDD. 
BREAK NOW, FIX LATER, that way we get where we are going.

Won't be released until coverage 99%, there are so many ides flowing and changes are constant that a lot of tests would have been binned.

## DATABASE
Using postgres, so you need to setup postgres
On Mac
```brew install postgresql@15```

## Installation
```npm install @hotwired/stimulus```

## Install gems
```bundle install```

## Generate dashboards for administrate

Remember to init your guard

Check stinky code, so many opinions, I relaxed rules

## Pricing functions
Pricing functions will have precision 15 and scale 6. US tax code has for example this type 6.1235% calculations, and there are currencies that you need to multiply by one million to dollar.
